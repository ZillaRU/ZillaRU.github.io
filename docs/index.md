#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Zhongying, a computer science grad with a knack for all things engineering. From diving into out-of-distribution detection at Hikvision to cracking the code on storage systems at Huawei, I've honed my engineering prowess. During my stint at Nutshell Therapeutics, I rocked algorithm reproduction and bioinformatics, showcasing my knack for quick learning. Now, as an Algorithm Engineer at Sophgo, I'm in the thick of business tool development and AI algorithm adaptionâ€“ truly flexing my engineering muscles. I'm all about staying ahead of the curve, soaking up the latest AI trends, and infusing them into real-world projects. Ready to connect, collaborate, and drive innovation in tech! ðŸš€ (Generated by GPT3.5)
